2. Purpose of Comments in HTML and Example:

Comments in HTML are used to add notes and explanations to your code. These comments are not displayed on the webpage but are visible when you view the source code. This makes comments useful for:

Improving code readability: Comments can explain the purpose of specific code sections, making it easier for others to understand and maintain your website.
Marking temporary changes: You can use comments to "comment out" code that you're not currently using, allowing you to easily test different versions of your page.

Adding notes: You can use comments to add notes to yourself or other collaborators about specific parts of your code.
